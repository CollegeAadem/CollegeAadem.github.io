    <p><strong>Main Thesis:</strong> Social media platforms must ensure fairness and equality in their advertising tools to prevent discrimination based on race, religion, or other protected characteristics.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Discrimination in housing advertising can be as harmful as discrimination in person.</li>
        <li>Algorithms used by tech companies can unintentionally perpetuate bias and discrimination.</li>
        <li>Should social media platforms be held responsible for the discriminatory actions of their advertisers?</li>
        <li>How can technology be used to promote fairness and equality in housing opportunities?</li>
        <li>What safeguards should be put in place to prevent discrimination in online advertising?</li>
        <li>Should users have more control over how their data is used for targeted advertising?</li>
        <li>Are there ethical considerations in allowing advertisers to target specific demographics on social media platforms?</li>
        <li>How can we ensure that everyone has equal access to housing opportunities, both online and offline?</li>
        <li>Should there be stricter regulations on how companies collect and use personal data for advertising purposes?</li>
        <li>Can technology truly eliminate bias in advertising, or will human oversight always be necessary?</li>
        <li>How do our online actions, such as liking certain pages or posts, influence the ads we see?</li>
        <li>Should companies like Facebook be transparent about how their algorithms work and how they impact users?</li>
        <li>What role should government agencies play in regulating online advertising to prevent discrimination?</li>
        <li>How can we raise awareness about the importance of fair housing practices in the digital age?</li>
        <li>Social media platforms like Facebook must ensure their advertising tools do not discriminate based on race, religion, or other protected characteristics.</li>
