  <h1> SIGCSE: When Are We Gonna Have a Serious Conversation About How Unserious (and Problematic) SIGCSE Is? </h1>
  <p>
    <strong>Main Thesis: </strong>The rejection of our group's plan by the SIGCSE Technical Symposium shows that some academic review systems aren't fair, especially when it comes to including different voices in computer science education.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Theses 1: Academic reviews often leave out different views, which means they don't always include important ideas.</li>
    <li>Theses 2: Not enough people from different backgrounds get noticed in the SIGCSE group, which means some people are excluded.   Causing diversity concerns</li>
    <li>Theses 3: Reviewers sometimes question the technical depth of panelists, showing bias against non-tenure track faculty and K-12 educators.</li>
    <li>Theses 4: There's a lack of consideration for hybrid formats in submissions, even though it may not always be necessary or relevant.</li>
    <li>Theses 5: Reviewers may suggest irrelevant improvements, like reducing the use of parentheticals, without considering the overall quality of the submission.</li>
    <li>Theses 6: Reviewers may focus on minor details, like citation formatting, instead of the substance of the submission.</li>
    <li>Theses 7: There's a failure to recognize the unique perspectives and contributions of panelists, especially those from underrepresented backgrounds.</li>
    <li>Theses 8: The review process may disproportionately benefit submissions that align with dominant perspectives and topics within the SIGCSE community.</li>
    <li>Theses 9: Reviewers may overlook the real-world expertise of panelists, especially if they're not in traditional academic roles.</li>
    <li>Theses 10: Suggestions for improvement may be inconsistent and reflect the reviewer's personal preferences rather than objective criteria.</li>
    <li>Theses 11: The review process may perpetuate systemic biases, particularly against submissions that challenge traditional notions of expertise and authority.</li>
    <li>Theses 12: There's a lack of accountability for reviewers who demonstrate bias or incompetence in their evaluations.</li>
    <li>Theses 13: Reviewers may lack awareness of their own biases and how they influence their evaluations of submissions.</li>
    <li>Theses 14: There's a need for greater diversity among reviewers to ensure a more inclusive and representative evaluation process.</li>
    <li>Theses 15: Overall, the peer-review process in SIGCSE needs to be more transparent, inclusive, and accountable to ensure fair and constructive feedback for all submissions.</li>
  </ul>
