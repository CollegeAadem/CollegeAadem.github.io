  <h1>Response Paper: "The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas"</h1>
  <p><strong>Thesis:</strong> Ursula K. Le Guin's "The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas" challenges the reader to confront the ethical implications of a utopian society built upon the suffering of a single individual.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The vivid portrayal of Omelas as a utopian city heightens the moral dilemma by contrasting its apparent perfection with the hidden suffering of a child. This stark contrast deepens the reader's ethical contemplation, questioning whether a society built on such foundations can genuinely be considered utopian.</li>
    <li>Utilizing second-person perspective, the narrative directly engages the reader in the moral quandary, implicating them in the city's collective happiness. This immersion fosters empathy and moral responsibility, compelling readers to confront their complicity in the exploitation of the child.</li>
    <li>While Omelas may outwardly appear utopian, its dependency on the suffering of one innocent child undermines any claim to true utopia. This contradiction challenges readers to question the morality of sacrificing an individual for the collective good.</li>
    <li>The plight of the child in Omelas parallels real-world instances of systemic injustice and exploitation, prompting reflection on the pervasive nature of such ethical dilemmas in society.</li>

    <li>Omelas' citizens share collective responsibility for perpetuating the city's moral dilemma through their acquiescence and complicity.</li>
    <li>Departing from Omelas can be interpreted as an act of rebellion against moral compromise or resignation to human imperfection.</li>
    <li>The symbolism of the locked door and the key represents the constraints of societal norms and the potential for liberation from oppressive systems.</li>
    <li>Omelas' citizens could pursue alternative courses of action to alleviate the child's suffering without compromising their own happiness, such as advocating for social reforms.</li>
    <li>The ambiguity surrounding the fate of those who leave Omelas invites reflections on the nature of ethical decision-making.</li>
