  <h1>Response Paper: "The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas"</h1>
  <p><strong>Theses:</strong> Ursula K. Le Guin's "The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas" challenges the reader to confront the ethical implications of a Utopian society built upon the suffering of a single individual.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The clear picture of Omelas as a Utopian city increases the moral dilemma by contrasting its perfection with the hidden suffering of a child. This contrast deepens the reader's ethical thoughts or ideas, questioning whether a society can genuinely be considered Utopian.</li>
    <li>Utilizing second-person perspective, the narrative directly engages the reader in the moral dilemma, implicating them in the city's collective happiness. This immersion emphasizes empathy and moral responsibility, encouraging readers to confront their complicity in the examination of the child.</li>
    <li>While Omelas may outwardly appear Utopian, its dependency on the suffering of one innocent child undermines any claim to true Utopia. This challenges readers to question the morality of sacrificing an individual for the greater good.</li>
    <li>The dread of the child in Omelas correlates with real-world instances of systemic injustice and exploitation, showing reflection on the common nature of such ethical dilemmas in society.</li>

    <li>Departing from Omelas can be interpreted as an act of rebellion against moral compromise or resignation to human imperfection.</li>
    <li>The symbolism of the locked door and the key represents the constraints of societal norms and the potential for liberation from oppressive systems.</li>

    <li>The ambiguity surrounding the fate of those who leave Omelas invites reflections on the nature of ethical decision-making.</li>
    <li>Genuine happiness and success can be achieved without resorting to exploitation or injustice by prioritizing ethical principles and valuing the dignity of every individual.</li>
